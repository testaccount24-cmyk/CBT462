    This macro should be invoked as an IMACRO or intial macro for an empty
    PDS member. It may be invoked from the command line of PDF Edit but
    only if the member is empty.

    Its purpose is to initialize the member with the format of an ISPF
    Dialog Manager Message member. Be sure that the dataset is unnumbered
    when invoking this command.

    Because it is a dialog program, invoke this command with an exclamation
    mark.   !NEWMSGS.
